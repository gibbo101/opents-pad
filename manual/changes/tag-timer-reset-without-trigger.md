A tag whose trigger has been destroyed keeps a null trigger when the destroyed one had no linked trigger to take its place. A trigger action that set a local or global variable then restarted every tag's timed events through that null trigger and crashed the game. The reset now skips a tag without a trigger, so the action completes and the other tags' timers restart as before.
